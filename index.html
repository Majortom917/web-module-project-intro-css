      <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200
        square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much
        more.</p>

    <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study how it interacts with the
      park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates about fires in Yosemite. Check for <span>current fire
        restrictions.</span></p>
